# Pokedex App -  CI Project

This is a CI project for my Software Development course at ITS Angelo Rizzoli.

Prerequisite:
- Python Knowledge
- Created a program that uses the PokeAPI to return information about Pokemon, similar to a Pokedex

Goals:
- Using CI operations to test the operations of the program
- Pytests for the information requested
- Json Schemas for the structure of the data requested
- Snapshot Testing to make sure data is not modified and works
- Create an Azure Function for the Pokedex App
